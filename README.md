# fzr

fzr is a command-line fuzzy finder.

## Features

- UTF-8 only.
- Case-insensitive ASCII matching: o matches o/O; O matches O only.
- Basic Unicode romanization: O matches ≈ê, ùë∂, üÖæ‚Ä¶ etc.
- ANSI colors: `\033[1;31mbold and red\033[m`.
- Mouse support.
- Non-fuzzy search: `'exact ^... $... !^...|!...$`.
- Sane ranking algorithm (based on an idiot's opinion).
- Minimal configuration.
